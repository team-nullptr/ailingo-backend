Repo provides you with `docker-compose.dev.yml` so that you can run the app easily in a contenerized environment.

To get started create a `.env` file which template is located in `.env.template` file. You can just copy and rename it. Then run: 
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
